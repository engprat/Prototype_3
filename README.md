**Prototype 3**

Prototype 3 is a Unity-based testing application focused on experimenting with importing and integrating various assets, such as textures, animations, and 3D models. This project serves as a development sandbox for understanding how different elements interact within a scene and identifying potential issues related to asset integration.

Features:
  - Asset Importing: The project includes functionality for importing and managing a wide range of assets, including textures, animations, and 3D objects. This allows users to test the process of bringing assets into Unity and evaluating their compatibility and performance.
  
  - Texture Testing: Various textures are applied to objects to assess how they render and interact with different lighting and material settings. This helps in understanding texture behavior and identifying potential issues with visual quality.
  
  - Animation Integration: The project features different animations applied to objects to test how they perform within the Unity environment. This includes evaluating animation smoothness, transitions, and interactions with other elements in the scene.
  
  - Object Handling: Users can experiment with importing and positioning 3D models, testing how they fit into the scene and interact with other assets. This includes evaluating scale, rotation, and placement to ensure proper integration.
  
  - Debugging and Optimization: Tools are provided to debug and optimize asset performance, helping to identify and address issues related to asset quality, compatibility, and efficiency.

Usage:
Prototype 3 is intended for developers and artists to experiment with asset importing and integration within Unity. It provides a flexible environment for testing how different textures, animations, and 3D models interact in a scene, aiding in the refinement of asset workflows and ensuring smooth integration into future projects.

Future Development:
As an experimental project, Prototype 3 is designed for ongoing development and refinement. Future updates may include expanded asset types, improved integration tools, and enhanced debugging features based on user feedback and testing results.
